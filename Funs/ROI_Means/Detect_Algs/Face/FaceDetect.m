%    Description
%    -----------
%
%    Identify an ROI from the bounding box of a frame using a specified Viola-Jones face detector. 
%    Then, determine whether the ROI should be considered valid according to certain criteria.
%    During the validation operations, also adjust the X- and Y-coordinates of the ROI to align 
%    with the dimensions of the full frame rather than with the dimensions of the bounding box.
%    
%    In addition to returning the ROI and detection information, also return color channels 
%    assigned during the operations for reuse in setting the thresholds for tailored 
%    skin-segmentation and for the skin-detection algorithm (see function 
%    ROIMeans_FirstRead_SetThresholds).
% 
%    -- Summary of reasons why a face-detection attempt will be considered unsuccesful --
%
%    - The detector (vision.CascadeObjectDetector) did not return an ROI
%
%        Possible reasons:
%
%        - A face, if present, was excluded in whole or in part by the bounding box. For bounding
%          box settings, see function FaceDetect_ConfigSetup. For a discussion, see function
%          ROIMeans_FirstRead_SetBoundingBoxes. 
%        - The specified minimum ROI size, which is an argument to vision.CascadeObjectDetector,
%          is too large, resulting in an accurate ROI not being detected. By default, the minimum 
%          ROI size is calculated automatically (see function ROIGeneralConfig_Setup); the minimum 
%          ROI size can also be set manually by arguments ROIMinWidthRatio and ROIMinHeightRatio. 
%          The following flags also influence the minimum ROI size:                          
%            - ROIMinWidthRatio
%            - ROIMinHeightRatio
%            - ROIMinWidthRatioIncreaseSec1 
%            - ROIMinHeightRatioIncreaseSec1
%            - ROIMinWidthRatioIncreaseSec2
%            - ROIMinHeightRatioIncreaseSec2
%         - The merge threshold, which is an argument to vision.CascadeObjectDetector, may be too
%           large. The merge threshold is assigned by function FaceDetect_ConfigSetup. 
%
%    - Validation criteria not met (see function FaceDetect_ROIValidate):
%
%        - Too many detections made (more than one face detections per frame)
%        - Rejected because of a low proportion of pixels classified as skin
%        - An ROI of a profile also contains a pair of eyes (i.e., the profile-eyes test)
%

%%%%%% Scan bounded area of frame with Viola-Jones face detector %%%%%%              

%Object faceDetector is either the primary, secondary #1, or secondary #2 Viola-Jones face 
%detector, as assigned in function ROIMeans_FirstRead_AlgSelector.

%An empty return variable indicates no detection was made.
%A variable with more than one rows indicates more than one detection was made. As only one face is
%expected to be present in the frame, more than one detection probably indicates one or more
%erroneous detections.

%The Viola-Jones algorithm uses a grayscale colorspace of the frame. A grayscale colorspace 
%variable, VidFrameGray, was assigned previously (by function ROIMeans_FirstRead_AlgSelector). The
%grayscale variable covers either the entire frame or a bounded portion of the frame.

%If at least one detection returned: M detections x 4 matrix; type double.
%If no detections returned: 0 x 0 element; type double.

%%%%%% Check validity of face-detection ROI %%%%%%

%Validate the ROI returned by a Viola-Jones face detector. 

%Also adjust the X- and Y-coordinates of the ROI to align with the dimensions of the full frame
%rather than with the dimensions of the bounding box.

%In addition to returning the ROI and detection information, also return color channels assigned 
%during the operations for reuse in setting the thresholds for tailored skin-segmentation and for 
%the skin-detection algorithm (see function ROIMeans_FirstRead_SetThresholds).
